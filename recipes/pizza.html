    <p>Neapolitan pizza is a round pizza with a raised, crispy and slightly charred edge. Topped with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella and one, or a couple of well-balanced toppings. But the two things that make Neapolitan pizza stand out are the flavor and consistency of the crust.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>922g Tipo 00 flour (100%)</li>
        <li>553ml cool water (60%)</li>
        <li>23g of fine sea salt (3%)</li>
        <li>1g of fresh yeast (0.1%) or 0.28g of active dry yeast (0.03%)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add water to a mixing bowl and dissolve the salt.</li>
        <li>Add 10% of the flour while mixing with your hands or a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>When you have a smooth, batter-like consistency add the yeast and dissolve it (you don’t want the yeast to be in direct contact with salt, as this may damage it).</li>
        <li>Gradually add the rest of the flour while mixing, until you end up with one, single mass.</li>
        <li>Move the dough out of the mixing bowl to the countertop, and start kneading. Knead the dough by hand for 15-20 minutes, or in a stand mixer at low speed for 10-15 minutes, until you get a pretty smooth dough. The goal is to develop gluten and incorporate air into the dough.</li>
        <li>Leave the dough covered to rest for 15-30 minutes.M</li>
        <li>Fold the dough over itself a few times and form a smooth, round dough.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in an airtight container, or in a bowl covered in plastic wrap, and let it rise for around 14 hours.</li>
        <li>After 14 hours, take out the dough, and cut it into dough balls of 250 grams each. Make sure the dough balls are smooth and even to get round, nice pizzas.</li>
        <li>Place the dough balls in a lightly floured proofing box and let them rise for another 10 hour. If you don’t have a pizza proofing box, you can place the dough balls individual bowls with lid or covered in plastic wrap instead.</li>
